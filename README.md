# Monthly_bill_generator
This Python script generates a monthly bill by calculating prorated charges for items active during a specified month. It processes input data (item details, start/stop dates), calculates the active days, groups similar items, and returns a detailed breakdown of line items and total revenue

# âœ… Step 1: Import necessary modules
# These are the tools we need to handle dates and group items together easily
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from collections import defaultdict
from pprint import pprint  # This is for displaying the final result in a more readable format

# âœ… Step 2: Define the item list
# This is the data for each item. Each item has start and stop dates, quantity, rate, etc.
